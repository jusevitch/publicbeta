# Welcome!

This website is a collection of various resources for topics that I like learning about. It also has several curated collections of tools, suggestions, and commentaries. You can also find my blog here.

Why this website? I'm the kind of person who's constantly exploring new ideas, topics, tools, and hobbies. This website is a place where I can organize and share what I find with others. I don't have time to dive into everything I find, but the hope is that someone else may find it useful.
