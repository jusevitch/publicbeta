# DAWs, VSTs, and Software

There are plenty of digital music tools you can get for free (or really cheap). Here are some of the best I've found.

For an even better, bleeding-edge list, I highly recommend the [Bedroom Producer's Blog](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/), where I originally found much of the following material.

## DAWs

[**Reaper**](http://reaper.fm/): This DAW isn't free, but it's totally worth spending $60 for. Reaper is powerful, customizable, and hackable (what other DAW comes with its own [custom scripting language and built-in IDE?](http://reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascript.php)). Don't be deceived by its minimalist interface--I highly recommend watching the [video tutorials](http://reaper.fm/videos.php) to see how much is under the hood.

[**Cakewalk by Bandlab**](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk): Surprisingly full-featured DAW for free. Unlimited tracks and comes with several good built-in instruments.


## VSTs

Check out the [BPB Free VSTs list](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/free-vst-plugins/) for a massive list of free VST instruments. Below are a few of my favorites.

[**Surge Synthesizer**](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/): Without a doubt the best free synthesizer I have ever used. Extremely customizable, excellent quality, and under active open-source development.

[**Helm Synthesizer**](https://tytel.org/helm/): Another excellent synthesizer. Lots of powerful options for customization.

[**Spitfire Audio Labs**](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs/): A huge collection of hybrid synthesized / sampled instruments. Excellent quality, although sometimes the built-in controls seem too simple and limiting.
