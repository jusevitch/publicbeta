It turns out that Matlab has no built-in capability for outputting colored text (although there seems to be a [file exchange library for that][1]). However if you want to keep things really simple (and if you like the color red), you can [print red text][2] by using the fprintf command:

```matlab
fprintf(2,'\nHello world\n')
```

Digging into the [documentation][3], this prints text to the standard error output; hence the red color.

In other news, here's a fantastic [blog post][4] by [Ben Crowder][5] on the concepts of digital gardens and [learning in public][6]. The digital gardens concept is pretty much exactly what I'm doing with this site, although I wasn't aware that this concept existed until today. The "learning in public" blog post was highly motivating--a great call to action to create. Share. Do something to add to the world. It was very reminiscent of ideas a leader from my church put out a while ago in a [2 minute video][7].
