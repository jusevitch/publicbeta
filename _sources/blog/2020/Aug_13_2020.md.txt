Always be working on your highlight reel.

I've discovered this while working at my internship this summer. As an employee, you are hired to deliver results. Your pay scale depends on the quantity and quality of tangible work you produce for your employer. You will be continuously assessed based on your contributions. It is unrealistic and illogical to expect your manager to figure out what you've done and how valuable it is. Your highlight reel is the ticket to informing them in a perfectly clear manner your worth to the company.

So always be working on your highlight reel. Finished solving an interesting problem? Document the solution and create a few quick PowerPoint slides explaining it. Completed an interesting piece of software? Profile and record the before/after performance and appearance to show that you contributed meaningful results. It's easier than you think for your mind to forget what you have accomplished, especially several weeks or months after you made the accomplishments.

Always be working on your highlight reel.
