My 18-month-old daughter has been showing a remarkable aptitude for music and singing. Over the last 1 1/2 months she's learned several songs to the point of being able to sing them herself. She's still working on word pronunciation, but her rhythm and tonality are remarkably accurate.

My wife and I have also discovered that she responds really well to learning when both music and visual elements are involved. In our (COVID-necessitated) home church lessons on Sundays we've started creating PowerPoint slide shows with images matching some of the songs we're teaching her. She learns remarkably quickly--even to the point of remembering some of the images later without the slides present. 

And, of course, she loves watching YouTube kids music videos on the (extremely rare) occasions when we let her.
