I have discovered a new source of entertainment: videos of tall trucks trying (and failing) to drive unscathed through short overpasses. These accidents are apparently so common at one intersection in Durham, North Carolina that there is an entire [YouTube channel][10-6-20-1] and [website][10-6-20-2] devoted to it. Very educational (no really--_respect the height limit_). I find it inexplicably riveting.

But even this overpass pales in comparison to its ["evil little brother"][10-6-20-3] in Westwood, Massachusetts.
