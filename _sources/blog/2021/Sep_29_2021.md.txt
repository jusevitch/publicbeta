# First Post Using Sphinx Book Theme

I'm in process of switching my website from the mkdocs Material theme to the Sphinx Book theme (which underlies the Jupyter Book project).

Why did I make the switch? The Material theme was excellent, but Sphinx and the Sphinx Book theme have some powerful features for including $\LaTeX$ equations, executable Jupyter code, blog posts, and more.

Here's some math:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
&\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(f(x) + g(x)u) \\
&\R \text{ (I used a \\newcommand to define this)}
\end{align*}
```
