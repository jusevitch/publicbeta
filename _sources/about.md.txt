# About

I'm a full-time Technical Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory performing research on autonomous systems. I comleted my PhD in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. You can read more about my work at my [personal website](https://usevitch.com/).

I find a vast range of topics interesting. I love learning, and  I'm constantly finding a huge list of resources and tools that I find interesting or useful.

## Personal Life

I follow Jesus Christ. Applying the principles He taught has helped me become a better man. My church is the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org).

In my spare time you'll probably catch me spending time with my wife and daughters, volunteering at my church, running, learning new programming languages, or composing music. I also love an occasional round of disc golf [^1].


[^1]: Not Frisbee golf. That's for amateurs :) And don't get me started on "frolf"...
